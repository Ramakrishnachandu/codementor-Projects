# Random Number Generator Web App

My entry for the **Random number generator web app** practice project on [*Codementor*](https://www.codementor.io/projects/web/random-number-generator-web-app-bz042v8kll). It's a simple app that allows you to choose how many dice you would like to roll (1-5) and how many sides each die should have (4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 20).

Here the link to the app itself:
